# Book Classification - Persian Books

The **National Library of Iran** organized a competition to tackle the challenge of **book classification**. Participants were provided with a large dataset containing **1 million Persian books** in text file format.  

In this project, my teammates and I developed a **statistical model** capable of classifying Persian books based on their content. Our model achieved an **accuracy of 50%**, demonstrating a promising approach for large-scale Persian text classification.
